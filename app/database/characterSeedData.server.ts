  backstory:
    "Kai Kealynn, hailing from the nomadic Feylune Sailors of Icewind Dale, grew up amidst the harsh beauty of the north. The tribe, known for their druidic and clerical wisdom, imparted to Kai a deep understanding of the natural world and herbalism. These early years, under the vast skies and amidst the ever-changing landscapes, shaped Kai into a skilled herbalist and a keen observer of the natural order.\n\nLife for the Feylune Sailors was a dance with the seasons. Spring and fall were times of land travel, marked by quiet trading with the outside world. But it was during the summers and winters that Kai's heart truly soared â€“ these were the seasons of sea voyages. The tribe's elders, wielding powerful druidic magic, steered their ice-made ship through the Trackless Sea, warding off pirate threats with a blend of elemental mastery and sheer intimidation. These journeys imbued Kai with a love for the sea's mysteries and a respect for its dangers.\n\nThe defining moment came when Varen, Kai's mentor, presented a parting gift, marking the end of Kai's tribal apprenticeship and the beginning of a personal quest. Leaving the familiarity of the tribe, Kai ventured into the wider world. The bustling cities like Neverwinter and Waterdeep were overwhelming at first, but Kai's adaptability and tribal knowledge eased the transition.\n\nAt the Neverwinter academy, Kai discovered a passion for archaeology. It was here that Kai met Dowvir, a fellow student and future ranger, with whom a lasting friendship was formed. Their shared connection to the Enclave sparked many collaborative ventures.\n\nDriven by tales of ancient wonders, Kai set sail for the Chultian jungles. There, amidst the dense foliage, Kai unearthed a mysterious medallion and a set of keys, their origins and purposes enigmatic and enticing. It was in these jungles that Kai also encountered a group of adventurers, assisting them against a Mantrap and briefly joining their quest for a rumored structure deep in the wilderness.\n\nHowever, a call from the Emerald Enclave regarding a situation off the coast of Neverwinter drew Kai away from Chult. With a trove of memories and unanswered mysteries, Kai set sail once more, ready to confront the new challenge, always carrying the spirit of the Feylune Sailors within.",

The Circle of the Land (Arctic) enhances their connection to the icy regions they hail from, while the Nature Domain strengthens their bond with the natural world. Kai's background as a Sage reflects their love for knowledge and archaeology.
